# Item Piles: Daggerheart

Get your loot goblins out and playing. This module configures the [ItemPiles module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/item-piles) for both [Daggerheart Unofficial](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/daggerheart-unofficial) and [Daggerheart Foundryborne](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/daggerheart).

Both systems provide basic support, note that Merchant do not fully function with Foundryborne as it currently does not have a way to set the cost per item.

### Installation Guide
